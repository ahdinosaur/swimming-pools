[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in terminals
Granddaddy had the golden keyboard, backspace every day in Arizona
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna save the world
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud fans, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get commits, fillin' up my stash, I see the code move
Changin' by the minute and the function on recurse
Wrote a line then another line, then somebody said to me:

[Hook]
"Friend, why you babysitting only two or three files?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a GitHub full of repos, then you dive in it
GitHub full of repos, then you dive in it
I wave a few commits, then I watch 'em all flock
All the coders wanna play Facebook
I got a GitHub full of repos and they dive in it
GitHub full of repos, I'mma dive in it

[Verse 2: dinosaur's Conscious]
(Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, dinosaur
I am your conscious, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, dinosaur
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, dinosaur)
If I create another repo, I'ma drown in some code, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feeling the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the technical debt arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:

[Hook]

GitHub full of repos, I'mma dive in it

I code, you code, push
One terminal, one hundred commits, push
Hop out, do you push?
Two terminals, two hundred commits, push
